What is this repository for?

This is my implementation of challenge #1 of the coding assessment. I have implemented it using Spring MVC.

How do I get set up?

To run this project you would have to use your own credentials which can be updated in the config.properties file

Enchancements for Challenge #2:

  Added POJO corresponding to recipe json.
  Added method in POJO to parse recipe json and convert it into Recipe
  java object.
  Added get method in spring controller to display all the recipe images
  in the UI(/getRecipe.do).
